tldr: "Introduces XOR‑type adversarial objectives (XORGAN): a pairwise discriminator and non‑zero‑sum parametric losses that aim to stabilize GAN training **without** gradient penalties; shows global optimality ($Q^*=P$) under standard assumptions and analyzes local stability."
abstract: "Recent advances in adversarial learning observe that stabilization with gradient
penalties trades off generated sample quality. We try to address this limitation by
proposing novel objectives inspired by the logical XOR operation, which should
not depend on gradient penalty regularization in order to be locally stable. In the
sections that follow, we will present a theoretical study on this type of objective
functions. We will prove global optimality conditions with similar assumptions
as those made in the original GAN paper by Goodfellow et al., we will notice
connections between the XOR-type objectives and the original GAN, and we will
define non zero-sum parametric objectives based on that connection. Finally, we
will attempt to study the local stability of the continuous-time training dynamical
system around desirable equilibria."
