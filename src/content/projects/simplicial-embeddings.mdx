**TL;DR.** SEM constrains representations to a product of simplices. That structure encourages sparsity and yields more predictable downstream behavior.

**What changes?** Replace unconstrained projections with softmaxes into L simplices of V dims each; train your SSL normally. The constraint is the inductive bias.  [oai_citation:5‡OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RWtGreRpovS&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Why it works (intuitively).** You trade raw capacity for structured features that cluster semantically relevant factors, improving linear separability after pretraining. The ICLR 2023 result was accepted as an **Oral (top 25%)**.  [oai_citation:6‡ICLR](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2023/oral/12601?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
