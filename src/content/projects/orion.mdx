**What it is.** Oríon is an async framework for black‑box optimization and experiment management designed to integrate with existing ML scripts. It prioritizes reproducibility and minimal friction.

**Why it matters.** Clean experiment lineage and scalable HPO save real time and cost, especially when you’re iterating on data/architectures.
